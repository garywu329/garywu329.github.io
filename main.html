                    <p>Heya, been a while, back to work on this, been really side tracked by Diablo and SF, the images for the photo reel are properly up now but i'll probably put it
                        on another page, this has been redesigned to be the main page with the previous page acting as an entry site.

                    <p>Back from China, will start actively updating this site again, I plan to upload a bunch of the pictures and stuff from the trip
                        preferably in a photo reel or something. For now, gonna rest a bit.</p>

                    <p>Hi there, been a while, not dead just had a lot of stuff happen to me in the past few months. I am currently in China! I still plan to update this website but it will probably be slower. The great firewall of China was my greatest enemy for these past few days but thanks to the patience of my girlfriend I now have access to the internet again! Hopefully during this trip I will have enough time to update the website and add some API integration.</p>

                    <p>Had a bit of an issue with the tutorial, along with some bad real life stuff come up....I'll be swapping to something else for information as the previously
                        linked tutorial has an API that is no longer active so I cannot pull data, hopefully update wont be so long this time.

                    <p>I started work on what seems to be an essential skill that recruiters are looking for, that is connecting and pulling data from an API,
                        I am not sure how I am going to implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) on a Ghibli film title but for now I am just trying to get data from Ghibli films.

                        very helpful tutorial I have found that I will be working with. Other then that I have cleaned up some code, standardizing my header so it looks more uniform.

                    <p>So i've decided to change the changes webpage to a blog styled website, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> W3Schools.com</a>
                    has been pretty helpful in trying to set this up. main reasons for this is a place to unload my thoughts and explain changes made if necessary.
                    The big goal that i have to get past at the moment from talking to a bunch of friends is to pull data from a database using REST api. I'll be chipping away at that
                    for a while I believe. But hopefully after its done, good things will come.</p>
