                        linked tutorial has an API that is no longer active so I cannot pull data, hopefully update wont be so long this time.

                    <p>I started work on what seems to be an essential skill that recruiters are looking for, that is connecting and pulling data from an API,
                        I am not sure how I am going to implement CRUD (create, read, update, delete) on a Ghibli film title but for now I am just trying to get data from Ghibli films.

                        very helpful tutorial I have found that I will be working with. Other then that I have cleaned up some code, standardizing my header so it looks more uniform.

                    <p>So i've decided to change the changes webpage to a blog styled website, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> W3Schools.com</a>
                    has been pretty helpful in trying to set this up. main reasons for this is a place to unload my thoughts and explain changes made if necessary.
                    The big goal that i have to get past at the moment from talking to a bunch of friends is to pull data from a database using REST api. I'll be chipping away at that
                    for a while I believe. But hopefully after its done, good things will come.</p>
